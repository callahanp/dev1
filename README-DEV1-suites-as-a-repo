# Making a repository for application suites.

## Repository for Dev1 support for an Applicaiton Suite

It's important to distinguish between materials to configure and use Dev1 and source materials on which you unleash Dev1.

Dev1's configuration files and interface scripts, can be placed in a repository.  The scripts and interface scripts then live in a folder under repositories and are subject to the same rules as any other repository. You can do full source control on these files just like any others.  

The bootstrap command initiates the process of creating an application suite and it starts with the suite repository. 

The only file needed is a *.json file with specifications for all the repository clones and standalone .git repositories required.

You can run the bootstrap command from anywhere, and the configuration file you provide will be moved into the right place among the other suites.
